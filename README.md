Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first project that I have created, a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java.

Main Class

The Main class is where the program starts. It creates an instance of the TicTacToe class, which starts the game.

TicTacToe Class

  The TicTacToe class is where the game logic and user interface is implemented. It implements the ActionListener interface, which allows the class to handle button clicks on the game board. The class has the following features:

Creates a JFrame and sets the basic layout and appearance of the game.
Displays a title panel at the top of the screen with the text "Tic-Tac-Toe".
Creates a 3x3 grid of buttons for the game board.
Alternates between "X" and "O" as players take turns clicking on the game board buttons.
Contains a check method which validates that, but it can be improved.
Check whether the game is won or not.

Future Projects

I plan to continue building more projects in the future. I will look for ways to improve my coding skills and expand my knowledge of different technologies. I also intend to take on more challenging projects, so I can continue to grow as a developer.
